The database block in system design refers to the part of the 
overall system architecture that deals specifically with how data is stored,
managed, and accessed within the system.

the database can be divided to different bases:
1- cold storgae: which is designed for data that is ment to be there for a long temr retention of other data that is accessed frequently.
2- replica: which is basically like a backup database that contains everything the other database have.
3-sharding: which basically breaks down a database if it is a large database to a smaller mroe managable pieces.
 Each shard is essentially a subset of the entire dataset and is
stored on a separate database server or node. Sharding is primarily employed to improve performance, 
scalability, and parallelism in systems dealing with massive amounts of data.
